        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>MIf you're looking for a homemade pizza crust recipe that's great for beginners, you're in luck.<br> 
            This top-rated recipe is super easy to throw together on a whim and it puts the store-bought stuff to shame.</p><br>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Yeast: Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the ingredient that causes the pizza dough to rise. </li>
            <li>Sugar: To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm water with a teaspoon of sugar. </li>
            <li>Bread flour: is ideal for pizza crust becauseit creates chewier results than all-purpose flour.</li>
            <li>Olive oil: Olive oil serves a couple purposes when it comes to pizza crust: Not only does it add color and flavor, but it creates a barrier between the oil and water. </li>
            <li>Salt: A little bit of salt goes a long way. Salt adds flavor, strengthens the gluten (creating a chewier crust), and slows down fermentation (resulting in a better rise). </li>
        </ul><br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza pan.</li>
            <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier. </li>
            <li>Let rest for 5 minutes. </li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li>
            <li>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan. </li>  
        </ol>
